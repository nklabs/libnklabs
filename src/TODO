nkdbase:

  more tests..
  try all input number formats, including negatives..

  make sure skipping works..

  Block read/write function for SPI-flash access in nkdbase

  nkoutfile_t that appends CRC
  nkinfile_t that checks CRC?

  should error output be an argument instead of nkstderr?  Better for threads

Nkscan:

  composing doesn't work properly: fscan1 && fscan2.  If fscan1 succeeds, input will be advanced even if fscan2 fails.  We would prefer
  no advancing for this case.

  iscan ignores case and squashes case on word and identifier.  Maybe word/identifier should be individually controllable?
  maybe case ignore should be changable in the format string?

  need tests for iscan

  Expression parser for nkscan?  Allow 0x before decimal?

  Some kind of options parser where we don't care about order- we can build this externally
    while tryopt1 || tryopt2 || tryopt3 || tryopt4

  Always allow whitespace before end of string?  Always allow whitespace before start of conversion?
  Do not ignore whitespace before doubles? (but strtod does this to match C-library standard).

  Versions of nkscan and friends which take a C-string, like sscanf?

  Also vs. sscanf:
    sscanf has character classes
    sscanf automatically skips whitespace before conversions (except for a few special cases)
    sscanf '*' modifier scans but doesn't save result

Get rid of global arrays:

  instead have a wrapper function with the array on the stack which calls the underlying function

Naming:

  nkinfile_t vs. nk_infile_t  type name
  nkdbase vs. nk_dbase        file name

nkinfile:

  How do we handle read errors for nkinfile operations?

Remember:

  It seems like a nice idea to use non-standard format sequences in nk_printf-
  but we can not if we also want gcc's built-in format string checking to work.  Therefore we
  have other printing functions:

	nk_indent
	nk_byte_hex_dump
	nk_dbase_fprint

        nkprintf / nkscan:

          Print not just a C-string, but also from an nkinfile

          But this then means that print depends on nkinfile...
          Likewise: Save output to an nkoutfile, not just to a C-string
