// File access abstraction

//  Access a string as a file
//  Access a memory block as a file
//  Access a block device as a file

// Supports random access through tell/seek

// This was written for nkscan and nkdbase, so that we can parse a database
// located in SPI-flash without first having to copy the string to a large
// RAM buffer.  Instead all of the parsing functions read the input as if
// it was a file, where the device level access is provided via block reads
// to a small buffer.
