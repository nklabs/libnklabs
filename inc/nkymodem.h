/* X/Y-MODEM serial file transfer protocol notes:

X-MODEM vs. Y-MODEM:

  X-MODEM Does not send filename, and there is only one file per transfer.

  Since there is no filename, size must be a mutliple of 128 bytes.  For text files,
  end of file is indicated by Ctrl-Z in last block.

  X-MODEM Starts with packet sequence number 1.

  Y-modem file header starts with sequence number 0.
  
  Y-modem file header starts with NUL if there are no more files in the transfer.

Why prefer Y-MODEM?
  1. It's simple and tiny (not a complex windowing protocol like zmodem)
  2. It's efficient, uses 1K packets (with -k option)
  3. It can handle binary data
  4. Exact transfer length is known (sent along with file name)
  5. Uses CRC16 for data integrity checking

Maybe Y-MODEM can handle Xon/Xoff handshaking, but only the sender should
have it enabled.  Y-MODEM receiver never sends XON/XOFF (but sender does! 
XOFF could occur in binary data or checksums, so receive side should not
handle XON/XOFF on input).

But in general it's better to provide a 1K buffer so that it can receive a
full packet without pushback.  Pauses between packets are no problem.

One bad thing is that there is no way for the receiver to indicate to the
sender that it can only handle 128-byte packets- but by default "sz" uses 128
byte packets if CRC is disabled, as follows:

    sz/sb command:

    If receive side sends 'C' (indicating that it wants CRC16 packets):
    sz              Tries zmodem, then falls back to ymodem with 1K option.
    sz --ymodem     Uses ymodem with 128 packets.
    sz --ymodem -k  Uses ymodem with 1K packets.
    sb              Uses ymodem with 128 byte packets.
    sx              Uses xmodem with 128 byte packets. (we get one retry?)

    If receive side sends 'NAK' (indicating that it wants checksum packets):
    sz              Tries zmodem, then falls back to ymodem with 1K packets.
    sz --ymodem     Uses ymodem 128 byte packets only.
    sz --ymodem -k  Uses ymodem with 1K packets. (cksum_count is less than long_count?)
    sb              Uses ymodem with 128 byte packets.
    sx              Uses xmodem with 128 byte packets. (we get one retry?)

    "sz" will try zmodem first, then fall back to Ymodem when it sees the 'C'. 
    But note that YMODEM receiver has to be prepared to handle the initial
    zmodem header as junk.

    "sz --ymodem" forces it to use Y-MODEM mode.

Sender uses a 1 minute timeout and the protocol is generally receiver driven.

Sender can send two CANs (Ctrl-Xs) to cancel a transfer:

	Valid when receiver is waiting for a packet.

Receiver can send CAN to cancel a transfer:

	Valid when sender is waiting for ACK.

Receive should handle any mixture of 128 or 1024 byte packets.  Transmitter
should not change packet sizes except after an ACK.  In other words, it
can't change the packet size on a resend due to a NAK.

Receiver has a 10 second timeout- it generally sends NAK on timeout, but instead
sends 'C' before the file header or first packet of file to indicate CRC16 packets.

Receiver should expect the next sequence number or a repeat of the same sequence number.
If invalid sequence number received, send CAN and abort- there is no way to recover from
a sequence number issue.

When sending a NAK, purge receiver first.  Purge means wait until sender has
stopped sending for at least 1 second.

Receiver sends 'C' to indicate its desire for CRC16 packets.  If it sends
NAK instead, sender uses checksum packets.

            return crc;
    }

CRC and checksum cover only the data part of the packet, not head SOH/STX or sequence number.

Checksum is just byte by byte add (no carry wrapping like TCP/IP).
