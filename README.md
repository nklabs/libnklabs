# NK Labs common library

This is our library for very quickly making products based on common 8-bit -
64-bit microcontrollers.  It is a layer added on top of the MCU vendor's
library that provides features required for almost every product.  It
provides these features:

### User interface

In this case, a UART-based command line interface (CLI) with history,
editing and tab-completion.  Commands are defined near the code they intend
to use- there is no need to edit a central command table or call any
registration functions.  This makes it easy to casually add commands for
debugging or bring-up.

The CLI is powerful enough to be customer facing.  There is on-line help and
commands can be marked to be disabled and hidden unless your product is in
some kind of "factory service mode".

Even if you do not need or want a customer facing CLI, having a CLI almost
always saves time.  It provides a way for team members to use the product
before it is finished.  For example, a test engineer might have to focus on
a specific peripheral for qualification.  Commands can be easily provided to
allow him or her to be independent, and not require a firmware engineer to
be present for every action.

### Firmware updates

Almost every product needs some kind of remote firmware update capability. 
This library provides one way to do it which can be extended to match your
needs:

First, you can download a firmware update file into local flash memory using
the YMODEM protocol over the CLI.  YMODEM is an old standard protocol for
transferring files over a serial port that is built into most terminal /
modem programs, such as TeraTerm and PuTTY.  This is nice, since no
host-side software has to be developed.

Second, after reboot, a bootloader copies the firmware from the local flash
memory (after doing a final integrity check) to the main MCU flash memory to
complete the update.

This local flash memory could be unused space in the MCU flash memory, or it
could be an external device such as a SPI-flash chip.

### Embedded database

Many products need some kind of non-volatile storage for calibration and
configuration settings- something akin to the Windows Registry.  We provide
a schema-defined database with schema-change / migration support for this. 
The idea is to save a serialized version of a C-structure into non-volatile
memory such as SPI-flash.  On boot up, the database is deserialized back
into RAM.  Fields can be added or deleted as the product evolves.  New
fields will be loaded with a default value, and data for deleted fields will
be ignored.

The C-structure can be arbitrarily complex (including arrays, strings and
substructures), but must not use pointers and must fit in a contiguous
region of memory.  Malloc is not used at all.  Arrays and strings are
variable in size, but bounded to a pre-allocated maximum size.

The serialized format of a database can also be transferred over the CLI. 
This allows you to save the database on a host computer.

The CLI provides an automatic interface to set or get individual fields from
the database.  You can index a part of the database using an expression,
somewhat similar to XML's XPath expressions.

See the [Example application commands](https://github.com/nklabs/libnklabs-examples/blob/main/doc/app.md) document to see how these
work.

### Common drivers and foundations

Some basic drivers for common devices are included:

* Flash memory
* SPI and I2C EEPROM
* Real Time Clock

But an ever growing set of drivers for other common ICs is also included. 

See the [drivers list](doc/drivers.md)

Some foundational libraries are also provided:

* A low memory footprint version of printf that supports floating point (it is smaller than newlib's printf).
* A unified parsing system: it's used for parsing command line arguments and deserializing databases.
* An instream / outstream library that redirects input and output from the above formatting and parsing functions to block devices or strings.
* A work-queue scheduler, replaces an RTOS in cases where you don't need preemption and your code is event driven.

### Other characteristics

* Malloc is not used at all to ensure determinism
* The example application includes watchdog timer support
* The build system includes automatic insertion of git hash, build date and version numbers into the binary.
* Commonly used cryptographic and CRC functions are also included
* The example application just fits on an STM32F030R8 (64K Flash, 8K RAM).  We recommend at least 96K of flash and 20K of RAM.

# Integrating libnklabs with your own project

It is recommended that you include libnklabs as a git "subtree" with the
following command:

    git subtree add --prefix libnklabs git@github.com:nklabs/libnklabs.git main --squash

This way you will have a copy (not a reference) to libnklabs.  You can
pull in the latest changes into your copy at any time with:

    git subtree pull --prefix libnklabs git@github.com:nklabs/libnklabs.git main --squash

The library is designed to be modular, though many of the modules depend on
each other.

Each module includes C source and header files.  But many also include a
configuration header file (.h) for customization options.  The idea is that
configuration header files should be tailored for the specific project, but
the source files should not be modified.

The configuration and header files are located in their own directories. 
These must be added to the include file search path, for example:

	gcc -I../config -I../inc -c nkscan.c

It is recommended to use -Os and link-time optimizations: these save space
by eliminating unused code.

# Example applications

Example applications for STM32 and ATSAM can be found in a different
repository, here:
