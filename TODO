High:

  STM32:  How do we handle STM32F746 flash memory? Sector sizes are not uniform..

Med:

  documentation: complete target descriptions

  Demo CLI manual

  Add i2c command to atmel
  EXT2 connector for i2c/spi? atsame70 has Arduino..  Assume arduino adapter for the others?

  nkymodem

    actual file download test

    write documentation

  Button and LED application

- - - - -

startup(), error(), .. these need nk_ prefix

Atmel:

  low power modes?  which is the best clock to use?

  should we be using systick or an atsam timer?

mcuflash:

  nkmcuflash rd and wr.. do 32-bit works, but on stm32 min. size is 8 bytes

rtc:

  better abtraction

  atsamd clock sometimes doesn't start until you read it.. are missing some initialization step?

  external rtc

bootloader:

  We should include an example standard bootloader to show off the ymodem/zmodem firmware udpate

Add more targets:

  Add RISCV
  Add Xilinx
  Add TI
  PIC32
  Some example in an RTOS

Add more peripherals:

  CAN, ADC, DAC, GPIO, etc..

event driven:

  multi-line gets for dbase

  nkymodem- pause cli input until communication is done

  maybe call sched recursively?

nkdbase:

  more generic way to deal with crc checking: the infile_t and outfile_t could be used for
  other things

  more tests..
  try all input number formats, including negatives..

  make sure skipping works..

  should error output be an argument instead of nkstderr?  Better for threads

  Finish schema compiler

Nkscan:

  iscan ignores case and squashes case on word and identifier.  Maybe word/identifier should be individually controllable?
  maybe case ignore should be changable in the format string?

  need tests for iscan

  Expression parser for nkscan?  Allow 0x before decimal?

  Some kind of options parser where we don't care about order- we can build this externally
    while tryopt1 || tryopt2 || tryopt3 || tryopt4

  Always allow whitespace before end of string?  Always allow whitespace before start of conversion?
  Do not ignore whitespace before doubles? (but strtod does this to match C-library standard).

  Versions of nkscan and friends which take a C-string, like sscanf?

  Also vs. sscanf:
    sscanf has character classes
    sscanf automatically skips whitespace before conversions (except for a few special cases)
    sscanf '*' modifier scans but doesn't save result

Get rid of global arrays:

  instead have a wrapper function with the array on the stack which calls the underlying function

Naming:

  nkinfile_t vs. nk_infile_t  type name
  nkdbase vs. nk_dbase        file name

nkinfile:

  How do we handle read errors for nkinfile operations?  Maybe use ssize_t
for block_read..

Notes:

  It seems like a nice idea to use non-standard format sequences in nk_printf-
  but we can not if we also want gcc's built-in format string checking to work.  Therefore we
  have other printing functions:

	nk_indent
	nk_byte_hex_dump
	nk_dbase_fprint

        nkprintf / nkscan:

          Print not just a C-string, but also from an nkinfile

          But this then means that print depends on nkinfile...
          Likewise: Save output to an nkoutfile, not just to a C-string
